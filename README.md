## My process

-still workin on the footer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	background-attachment: fixed;
	/* eventhough it seems like I didn't need it in the end but it was helpfull through the process and I will definetly use it in the future */
}
```

I also discovered this great source which i will defenitely use for my next documentation :
[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

### Continued development

I need to focus more with the Flexbox tools even though I did well, but there is too much more to discover with this wonderful tool, also I need to learn more about Grid, that would be helpfull with such a project.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

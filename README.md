## My process

-still workin on the footer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	background-attachment: fixed;
	/* eventhough it seems like I didn't need it in the end but it was helpfull through the process and I will definetly use it in the future */
}

.proud-of-this-css2 {
	filter: brightness(0) invert(1);
}
/* this helped me to change the color of the given logo without the need of another logo which I will definetly need in my future project */
```

I also discovered this great source which i will defenitely use for my next documentation :
[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

### Continued development

I need to focus more with the Flexbox tools even though I did well, but there is too much more to discover with this wonderful tool, also I need to learn more about Grid, that would be helpfull with such a project.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://fontawesome.com) - I Used fontawsome for icons.
